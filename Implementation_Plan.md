## Bill Williams Market Entry Logic Compliance Tasks (Phase 3.5)

**Objective:** Achieve full compliance with Bill Williams Trading Chaos market entry logic.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement explicit Three Wise Men staged entry logic:
    - [ ] First Wise Man: Detect reversal bar outside Alligator‚Äôs mouth, confirmed by AO color.
    - [ ] Second Wise Man: Detect AO saucer pattern for add-on entry.
    - [ ] Third Wise Man: Detect fractal breakout for further add-on.
- [ ] Add Alligator ‚Äúawake/sleeping‚Äù state detection and filter trades accordingly.
- [ ] Implement reverse pyramiding (decreasing position size for add-ons).
- [ ] Update stop loss logic: place initial stop below/above reversal bar, use trailing stops for add-ons.
- [ ] Refine exit logic: exit on opposite reversal bar, AO cross, or opposite fractal.
- [ ] Update tests to cover all new logic and edge cases.
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new, fully Bill Williams-compliant entry/exit logic.
