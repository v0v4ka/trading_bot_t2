# Implementation Plan: AI Multi-Agent Trading Bot MVP

## Overview
This plan outlines the phased implementation of a multi-agent trading bot MVP using the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework. It is based on the product spec, current codebase, and APM best practices. Each phase is broken down into actionable tasks, with clear deliverables and agent assignments.

---

## Phase 1: Data & Indicators Foundation (Complete)

- **Task 1.1:** Establish foundational project structure
  - Status: ✅ Complete
  - Artifacts: Project directories, Poetry/requirements, README
- **Task 1.2:** Implement Yahoo Finance data fetching and OHLCV models
  - Status: ✅ Complete
  - Artifacts: `src/data/data_provider.py`, `src/data/models.py`, tests
- **Task 1.3:** Implement Bill Williams indicators engine (Fractals, Alligator, Awesome Oscillator)
  - Status: ✅ Complete
  - Artifacts: `src/indicators/`, tests

---


## Phase 2: Minimum Viable Backtesting & Visualization (Priority)

- **Task 2.1:** Implement trading signal logic for market entry assessment
  - Define entry/exit rules using Bill Williams indicators (Fractals, Alligator, Awesome Oscillator)
  - Output entry/exit signals for backtesting
  - Deliverable: `src/signals/`, tests
- **Task 2.2:** Integrate a simple backtesting engine
  - Use historical OHLCV data and generated signals to simulate trades
  - Calculate and report entry point quality metrics (e.g., win rate, profit factor)
  - Deliverable: `src/backtest/`, tests
- **Task 2.3:** Visualize bars, indicators, and entry points
  - Plot OHLCV bars, overlay indicators, and mark entry/exit points
  - Use matplotlib or similar for output
  - Deliverable: `src/visualization/`, sample charts

---

## Phase 3: Agent Orchestration & CLI (Deferred)

- **Task 3.1:** Design and implement agent orchestration framework (deferred)
  - Define agent roles and communication logic
  - Deliverable: `src/agents/` package, orchestration tests
- **Task 3.2:** Implement CLI for running simulations and reporting results (deferred)
  - Deliverable: `src/cli.py`, CLI tests

---

---


## Phase 4: Documentation, Review, and Handover

- **Task 4.1:** Update and finalize documentation (README, usage guides)
- **Task 4.2:** Review, test, and prepare for handover using APM protocols

---

## Memory Bank System
- Continue using the single `Memory_Bank.md` file for chronological logging, as established.
- If project complexity increases, consider migrating to a `Memory/` directory per APM guidelines.

---


## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 2, Task 2.1: Implement trading signal logic for market entry assessment.
- Manager Agent to prepare the Task Assignment Prompt for this task.
