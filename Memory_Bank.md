## [2025-07-18] Backtesting Framework Implementation (Phase 3, Task 3.1)

### Tasks Completed
- **Core Backtesting Engine**: Created comprehensive `src/backtesting/engine.py` with BacktestEngine class that processes historical data through Signal Detection and Decision Maker agents to simulate trading performance.
- **Performance Metrics System**: Implemented `src/backtesting/metrics.py` with Trade and BacktestResults classes, plus PerformanceAnalyzer for calculating comprehensive metrics (returns, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, profit factor, trade statistics).
- **Configuration Management**: Built `src/backtesting/config.py` with BacktestConfig class and predefined scenarios (conservative, balanced, aggressive) for flexible backtesting parameters.
- **Integration Testing**: Created full test suite with 51 tests covering configuration validation, trade calculations, performance analysis, and engine functionality.
- **Integration Example**: Developed `backtesting_integration_example.py` demonstrating end-to-end usage patterns.

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into engine (execution), metrics (analysis), and config (parameters) modules.
- **Agent Integration**: Engine initializes Signal Detection and Decision Maker agents with historical data and processes each timestamp sequentially.
- **Trade Simulation**: Implemented simplified trade execution for MVP - positions are closed immediately with small random variation to simulate realistic exits.
- **Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive metrics including basic stats, risk metrics, time-based analysis, and consecutive trade tracking.
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Support for predefined scenarios plus custom configuration with validation.

### Trade Simulation Logic
```python
# Core backtesting workflow:
1. Load historical OHLCV data via DataProvider
2. Initialize Signal Detection and Decision Maker agents
3. Process each timestamp:
   - Check stop losses for open positions
   - Get signals from Signal Detection Agent
   - Get decisions from Decision Maker Agent
   - Execute trades based on decisions
   - Update equity curve
4. Close remaining positions and calculate final metrics
```

### Integration Challenges & Solutions
- **Agent Dependencies**: Fixed DataProvider initialization by deferring creation until needed with symbol/interval parameters.
- **Column Naming**: Standardized on uppercase OHLCV column names (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) to match indicator expectations.
- **Test Isolation**: Used mocking for agent classes in tests to avoid OpenAI API dependency during testing.
- **Performance Calculation**: Implemented accurate P&L calculation for both BUY and SELL trades with transaction costs.

### Testing Methodology & Validation
- **51 comprehensive tests** covering all modules with 100% pass rate
- **Unit tests**: Individual class functionality (Trade, BacktestConfig, PerformanceAnalyzer)
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end engine workflow with mocked agents
- **Validation tests**: Configuration validation, metrics calculation accuracy
- **Edge case coverage**: Insufficient capital, empty results, invalid configurations

### Code Examples & Usage Patterns
```python
# Basic backtesting usage
config = BacktestConfig(
    symbol="AAPL",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    end_date=datetime(2023, 12, 31),
    initial_capital=10000.0,
    signal_confidence_threshold=0.7
)

engine = BacktestEngine(config)
results = engine.run_backtest()
analyzer = engine.get_performance_analyzer()
metrics = analyzer.calculate_metrics()

# Performance metrics available:
- Total trades, win rate, total return
