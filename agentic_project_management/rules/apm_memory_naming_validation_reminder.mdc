# Memory Bank: Pre-Creation Validation Reminder

Before creating any Memory Bank directory or file:

1.  **Validate:** Cross-reference the proposed name and location with the *current, authoritative* `Implementation_Plan.md`.
2.  **Adhere:** Ensure strict adherence to naming conventions.

**Consult:** `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md` (Sections: "Strict Adherence to Implementation Plan" & "Validation Before Creation").
