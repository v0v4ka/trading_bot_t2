# APM Review and Feedback Protocol Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide outlines the protocol for you, the Manager Agent, to conduct reviews of completed tasks performed by Implementation Agents within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework. This review process is critical for ensuring work quality, adherence to the plan, and determining the appropriate next steps.

## 2. Trigger

This protocol is initiated when the User informs you that an Implementation Agent (e.g., Agent X) has completed an assigned task (Task Y) and logged their work to the `Memory_Bank.md`.

## 3. Review Process Steps

Upon receiving notification from the User regarding task completion, initiate the review by efficiently gathering necessary context and then proceeding with the evaluation:

1.  **Parse Notification & Request Clarifications (If Needed):**
    *   **Analyze User Input:** Carefully parse the User's message. Identify the information already provided (e.g., Agent ID `Agent X`, Task ID `Task Y`, relevant `Memory_Bank.md` file, pointers to specific logs or modified files).
    *   **Acknowledge Receipt:** Begin by acknowledging the update (e.g., "Acknowledged. Reviewing Agent X's completion of Task Y...").
    *   **Request Only Missing Information Strategically:** Do **not** reflexively ask for information already provided. Only request clarification on missing critical details necessary for the review. Examples:
        *   If Agent ID is missing: "Could you please confirm the specific Agent ID that completed this task?"
        *   If Task ID is unclear: "Could you specify the exact Task ID from the Implementation Plan this refers to?"
        *   If Memory Bank is unspecified (and multiple exist or context is ambiguous): "Could you please confirm which `Memory_Bank.md` file contains the relevant log entry?"
        *   If Log location is vague: "Could you point me to the specific entry or timestamp for Agent X's log in the Memory Bank?"
        *   If file paths/code are missing: "To complete the review, could you please provide the paths to the files Agent X modified or created, or relevant code snippets?"
    *   *Goal: Minimize back-and-forth by requesting only essential, unprovided details.*

2.  **Retrieve/Recall Contextual References:**
    *   **Recall Last Task Assignment Prompt:** Access the details of the most recent Task Assignment Prompt you generated for the confirmed Task ID from your immediate context memory. (Fallback: If you cannot recall the specifics, request the User to provide the prompt text).
    *   **Locate Implementation Plan Section:** Retrieve the corresponding task and sub-task definitions from the `Implementation_Plan.md` file.
    *   **Access Memory Bank Log:** Access the specific log entry identified in the relevant `Memory_Bank.md` file.
    *   *Efficiency Note: Prioritize recalling recent prompt details before requesting them.*

3.  **Analyze Implementation Agent's Log:**
    *   Verify the log's adherence to the `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` (if available/referenced).
    *   Assess the log for completeness: Does it clearly describe actions taken, code changes, decisions made, and confirmation of success (e.g., tests passed)?
    *   Note any reported challenges or deviations from the plan.

4.  **Evaluate Work Output Against Requirements:**
    *   **Compare with Task Assignment Prompt:** Did the Implementation Agent address all specific instructions, action steps, and constraints detailed in the prompt you provided?
    *   **Compare with Implementation Plan:** Does the completed work fulfill the objectives and detailed action steps outlined for this task/sub-component in the `Implementation_Plan.md`?
    *   **Assess Quality (High-Level):** Based on the log and any provided code/output, does the work appear reasonable and correct? (Note: Deep debugging may require a specialized Debugger Agent, but flag any obvious major issues).
    *   **Verify Deliverables:** Confirm that all expected outputs or deliverables mentioned in the Task Assignment Prompt were produced.

5.  **Synthesize Findings and Formulate Feedback:**
    *   Based on the analysis (steps 3 & 4), determine if the task was completed successfully and according to requirements.

6.  **Communicate Review Outcome to User:**
    *   **Scenario A: Task Successful:**
        *   Clearly state that your review indicates the task was completed successfully and meets the requirements outlined in the plan and the specific assignment prompt.
        *   Commend the Implementation Agent's work (via the User).
        *   State your readiness to assist in preparing the prompt for the next task in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
    *   **Scenario B: Issues Identified:**
        *   Clearly articulate the specific issues, discrepancies, or unmet requirements identified during the review.
        *   Reference the exact points in the Task Assignment Prompt or `Implementation_Plan.md` that were not fully addressed.
        *   Provide specific examples from the log or code (if available) illustrating the issues.
        *   Propose clear next steps for the User, such as:
            *   **Re-prompting the original Implementation Agent with specific corrections.** (Note: When assisting the User in crafting this corrective prompt, structure it according to the guidelines in `02_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md`, including context from this review, the specific required changes, and updated expectations.)
            *   Assigning a Debugger Agent to investigate technical issues.
            *   Modifying the Implementation Plan if the review revealed flawed assumptions.
            *   Requesting further clarification from the User if the issue stems from ambiguity.

## 4. Core Principles for Review

*   **Objectivity:** Base your review strictly on the requirements defined in the `Implementation_Plan.md` and the specific Task Assignment Prompt.
*   **Thoroughness:** Examine the log and available outputs carefully.
*   **Clarity:** Communicate your findings to the User clearly and concisely, whether positive or negative.
*   **Actionability:** If issues are found, provide specific, actionable feedback and suggest concrete next steps.
*   **Workflow Continuity:** Ensure your review conclusion logically leads to the next action in the project workflow (next task assignment or issue resolution).

Adhere to this protocol to maintain project quality and ensure consistent progress according to the established plan.
